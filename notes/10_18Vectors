October 18th, 2018: Vectors
-----------------------------------------------
You can instantiate an array with less entries than the number specified. In that case the entries are pushed to the beginning and the last entries are filled with zeros. 

We can pass by reference to for ranged-based loops too - by using

	for (int &e : array)

When e is modified in the for loop, it will change globally - e will be accessible outside the for loop! 

Vectors_________________________________________
Vectors are another library that can be included
Vectors an be instantiated many ways 
	vector<type> myVector[size]{elements}; 
	vector<type> myVector(size,single element); 

Instead of accessing your vector using [], use the method at(). This will catch throw errors forout-of-bounds indexes (at the cost of slower compling) 

	NO! myVector[5] = 0; 
	Yes! myVector.at(5) = 0; 

Other vector methods: 
	.size()
	.front()
	.back() 
	.push_back()

Multidimentional Vectors: 
You can have multidimensional vectors with vectors of vectors.

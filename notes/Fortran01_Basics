Fortran!

Header always starts with
program programname
implicit none 

MUST declare variables at the top - no other place to declare! 

Ends with end program programname

No semicolons - every line defines new line
can concantenates line using ampersand (&) 

Printing

	print* , 'stuff', 4

The second comma adds the 4 onto the line, but at the next tab column

Variables

All of these are variables: 
real
integer 

Declare variables like so: 
implicit none 
integer :: i,n = 0
real :: age

i = 0
age = 10.3 

names also cannot include non-alphanumeric characters, other than _ 
names must start with a letter 

NOTE: if implicit none is not specified in a program
variables with names that begin with the letters i - n are integers by default
variables with names that begin with a-h or o-z are of type real by default

Arithmetic Expressions -----------------------
** - exponent 

Kind/Length -------------------------------
the size of types can be specified in Fortran: 

integer[kind = 4] ::j
kind specifies bytes
len specifies length for strings

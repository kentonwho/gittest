Fortran is column major! 
Arrays go (j,i) instead of (i,j)
So, for loops are "transposed"
Declaring a static size array is simple, and follows declaration from a variable: 

real, dimension(5,2) :: matrix 

array multiplication is similar to Matlab, in that it is built-in: 
arraynew = arrayold * 2 // is a valid command



DYNAMIC ARRAYS 
allocating a dynamic arrya means you have to declare the matrix as an allocatable array, then use 
	
	allocatate(x_1d(n), stat = ierror)
